<p>Nicholas Martellaro: a journy</p>
<img src="images\mizzou.jpg" atl="something happened">
<p>It took me a long time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I went to a number of diffent schools in my life.  I went to
    <a href="https://www.statetechmo.edu/"> Linn State Technical College</a>, <a href="http://missouri.edu/">The University of Missour</a>, and <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a>.
     At first I wanted to work with computers, and I persued an education in
    computer networking. Very close to ending my education, I decided that I wanted a change.  I decided to study Art History and Archaeology, while I love the field
    I was not able to continue my education further. </p>

<p>For years after completing my education, I hunted for jobs within the field of Art History and Archaeology, but to no evail.  I worked many customer
    service jobs as a grocery store department manager, manager of a pizza resturant, and customer care represtentative at a home security company.
    I found none of the work fulfilling, and needed something new.  At a wedding for a friend, I ran into another friend from the past.  He had a similar
    experiance to mine, but he took a certificate program for Geospatial Information Systems.  He became a map maker and spoke highly of the work.
    It sounded appealing and I took this route for myself.</p>

<p>After completing my course work and getting a post-baccalaureate certificate, I eventually recieved my first position as a GIS technician.
    after a year in the field I was laid off due to contract work not coming in fast enough for the staffing levels that the company had.
    While getting drinks and drowning our sorrows with some co-workers, I found that one of my co-workers, who has been in the field for 20 years,
    has been laid off 6 times. I felt that I need better job security and have always liked programing.  While in highschool, college and in my certificate
    program, I study some programing and enjoyed it each time.</p>
